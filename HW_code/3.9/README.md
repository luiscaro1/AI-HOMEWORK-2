The structure of the code is class-based where we define Nodes, Problems, Searches and States. The iterative deepening search is used as an example of one of the alogrithms studied in the course for chapter 3. After running this programs a small text-based output will show the state tree of the problem.

The project doesn't require any 3rd party packages

you can proceed to run the project with the command:

python main.py

NOTE: For this project I used python 3.8 as long as you have at least 3.6+ you should be fine.
