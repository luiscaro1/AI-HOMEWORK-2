The structure of the code is class-based where we define Points, Segments and Polygons. The Dijkstras shortest algorithm is used as an example of a Breadth-first search superset discussed in Chapter 3.
A small example is placed as default with a visual representation of the output.

The project requires the following packages:
-matplotlib
-tqdm

Once you have those installed you can proceed to run the project with the command:

python main.py

NOTE: For this project I used python 3.8 as long as you have at least 3.6+ you should be fine.
